Developers and other professionals often need to open a bunch of programs to work on a project, and the process of switching from one to the other may become repetitive.
DeskEnv lets you create collections of programs called _environments_ and run them all with a single button.

## Install and update with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/deskenv/)
## Download the latest version: [Releases](https://github.com/erap320/DeskEnv/releases)

### Program options
The available options, which can be set for each program, are:
- Additional command line arguments
- Run minimized
- Run as administrator

## Exporting your environments
All your environment definitions are saved to `%appdata%\DeskEnv\environments.json`.\
If you wish to export them to another machine, copying this file to the same folder will be enough.
